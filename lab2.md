It is important to choose a license because, without one, atleast in America, the software would have all rights reserved.  Some people mistakenly believe that if they do not license their software, that it is considered public domain, which is not the case.  Employing an open source license is about granting permission, not claiming ownership or restricting access.  Copyright laws can vary greatly, so it is also important to choose a license so that what's considered fair use for your software is up to you and is the same across the world.

Why shouldn't you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?  Depending on the copyright laws in your jurisdiction, you could actually be breaking the law.  You may also be going againt the wishes of the orginal creator if, for example, you use it for business purposes or create a derivative work and don't give credit to the orginal creator.  You are also tacitly supporting the act of not licensing software by using unlicensed software.

I do agree with the claim that having the development process open is generally superior to a centralized development process.  By utilzing the base of people who use your product, people who have a vested interest in your software, you can more quickly make changes and follow the direction that your users want.  They want to see the software grow and prosper as they use it themselves and will have motivation to help.
