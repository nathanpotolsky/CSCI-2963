It is important to choose a license because, without one, at-least in America, the software would have all rights reserved. Some people mistakenly believe that if they do not license their software, that it is considered public domain, which is not the case. Employing an open source license is about granting permission, not claiming ownership or restricting access. Copyright laws can vary greatly, so it is also important to choose a license so that what's considered fair use for your software is up to you and is the same across the world.

Why shouldn't you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license? Depending on the copyright laws in your jurisdiction, you could actually be breaking the law. You may also be going against the wishes of the original creator if, for example, you use it for business purposes or create a derivative work and don't give credit to the original creator. You are also tacitly supporting the act of not licensing software by using unlicensed software.

I do agree with the claim that having the development process open is generally superior to a centralized development process. By utilizing the base of people who use your product, people who have a vested interest in your software, you can more quickly make changes and follow the direction that your users want. They want to see the software grow and prosper as they use it themselves and will have motivation to help.

Linux uses the GPL v2 license, which allows for the running, review, modification, and sharing of the software. Linux uses this license as the OS was born out of the desire to have a free and open-source operating system. By allowing users to modify the operating system, the OS will grow faster, will be closer to what the community actually wants, and will be more robust overall than when an OS is made by for-profit companies.

Example project idea: A lightweight operating system that can be used to identify computer issues with different diagnostic tests, format hard drives, clone disk images, etc. The operating system could go on a flash drive or a cd and would be generally used for an IT help-desk or a savvy home computer user. For this project, I would use the MIT license. I'm not looking to make money off this idea, I'm okay with people making their own versions, I would only want to be given original credit. Additionally, this license appeals to me because I would not want to be held responsible if anything were to go wrong, which very well could happen when testing/formatting/cloning hardware.

Apache seems to be better for business as you can use it for business purposes, it can be used privately, it can be sub-license, uses patent claims, and can have a warranty for the software. Additionally, the businesses name, trademarks, and logos are protected. The GPL and LGPL licenses are similar and I feel that would be good for developers and the common good alike. Software with these licenses allow for open use and editing. This is a very useful thing for developers, which, in turn, is beneficial to the common good too.
