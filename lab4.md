I un-capitalized two words to be consistant with the other discriptions.  It is really important to use good documentation because that is how people can learn to use your software, troubeshoot their issues, and is incredibly useful for those who want to contribute to your open-source project.  FreeBSD says on their website that proper documentation is just as important as proper code.  This is how we should also go about documenting our software.  I learned what BSD is, as well as FreBSD and OpenBSD.  Addtionaly, I learned about SVN and how to use it on a very basic level.
