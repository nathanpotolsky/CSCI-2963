#-Comparison-

Observatory:

Git information by hand vs GitStats:
Contributors - gitstats says there are 30, but I found only 26
Lines of code - I found 11592 vs 11506
First and latest commit - gitstats is consistent with what I found by hand
Current branches: gitstats is consistent with what I found by hand

Auto Route:
* Contributors - GitStats shows 8 contributors, 3 more than the 5 from before.  These 3 users have contributed very little to the project so I assume that's why GitHub doesn't list them
* Lines of code - 52,071, a little higher than the 52,066 I got before
* Report Period
  2015-02-06 22:52:47 to 2016-02-29 14:56:26
  Age
  388 days, 137 active days (35.31%)
  This fits with what I found before
* Current branches - Couldn't find branch information in GitStats

Git Stats:

All the same data line up: Number of lines, contributors, and commit info were all in accordance with what I found, but with more details in a more readable format. There didn't seem to be info on branch/merge history, though. 

This is a pretty small project with few contributors, so I don't expect there to be much of a discrepancy in the data.
